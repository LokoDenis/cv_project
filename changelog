- added first-steps.cpp and the first-steps folder, which contains some images to visualize the progress.
This prothgram shows basic operations with openCV matrix, such as rotation and color inversion.

- added grads_and_etc.cpp and the Gradients folder, which contains some images to visualize the progress.
This program shows basic operation with gradients by X and Y axes.

- added detectors.cpp and the Detected_dotes folder, which contains some images to visualize the progress.
This program shows some operations with detectors, descriptors and image matching. There are used different commands for same operations to show the difference between them.

- added base_search.cpp.
This program saves pictures in the specified folder to a file. There is used a custom "image" structure.

- added clustering.cpp and clusters folder. 
This program show the operation of image clustering using the k-mean method.

- removed base_search.cpp and created base_creation.cpp instead.
This program (currently untested) is supposed to create a library of visual words for pictures in specified folder.
There is used a structure called "image", which contains a desctripor matrix and a visual words vector of each picture. 
There are some functions, which make the process simplier: "TF_IDF", "base_walk", "to_visual_words" and "save".

- 12th April modified base_creation.cpp
added "menu" and some more functionality. Resolved problems with saving vectors, matrices and etc. Base creating works properly. 

- 13th April modified base_creation.cpp
  changes:
          * added function for modifying the existing base with new pictures
          * completely reworked names of variables, functions and custom type to be more "human-friendly"
          * added some functions aiming on reading and operating with previously saved data

- 14th April modified base_creation.cpp
  bugs related to type mistakes fixed, but still the search doesn't work properly
  
- 15th April modified base_creation.cpp
  changes:
	  * image search now WORKS YAY
	  * finally decided on the structure for images folder
	  * rewrited descriptor calculation. now it uses float types as in kmeans thus iterators.
  future enhancements:
	  * rewrite adding an image with the usage of iterators so as to have an opportunity to add pictures with different names
  	  * work on clustering to optimise the search
