- added first-steps.cpp and the first-steps folder, which contains some images to visualize the progress.
This prothgram shows basic operations with openCV matrix, such as rotation and color inversion.

- added grads_and_etc.cpp and the Gradients folder, which contains some images to visualize the progress.
This program shows basic operation with gradients by X and Y axes.

- added detectors.cpp and the Detected_dotes folder, which contains some images to visualize the progress.
This program shows some operations with detectors, descriptors and image matching. There are used different commands for same operations to show the difference between them.

- added base_search.cpp.
This program saves pictures in the specified folder to a file. There is used a custom "image" structure.

- added clustering.cpp and clusters folder. 
This program show the operation of image clustering using the k-mean method.

- removed base_search.cpp and created base_creation.cpp instead.
This program (currently untested) is supposed to create a library of visual words for pictures in specified folder.
There is used a structure called "image", which contains a desctripor matrix and a visual words vector of each picture. 
There are some functions, which make the process simplier: "TF_IDF", "base_walk", "to_visual_words" nd "save".
