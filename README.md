### LSWWC Project ###

* This is the project based on The OPENCV library. Supporting by Denis Belyakov, 1st course student of the faculty of Computer Science, Higher School of Economics.

* The aim of this project is to create a program (or maybe an application), which will be able to show images from a base looking the same to the inputted one. It involves doing research in the Computer Vision sphere and learning about basic operations with pictures. 

* The informal idea of the "LSWWC" project is to learn about time-management, advanced usage of google and basic operations with UNIX-based OS, to develop social skills and the sense of responsibility, to create smth usable and make first steps in the mysterious and very interesting road called "Computer Vision".

* Current version 0.95

So, Let's SEE What We Can!

Guided by Vadim Gorbachev.




### About source files and directories ###

* first_steps.cpp and "first_steps" dir - includes examples of basic operation with images, such as rotation and color inversion. 
* detectors.cpp and "detectors" dir - includes examples of detectors' and descriptors' work plus matching.
* clustering.cpp and "clusters" dir - includes examples of clustering on one image.
* grads.cpp and "gradients" dir - shows the look of gradient vectors on pictures
* "report" folder contains my work report for the second checkpoint
* "helpful_vision" folder contains helpful project files, such as building a base, resizing images, cleaning the source from corrupted pictures and etc.
* "bot" directory contains files related to parsing web-pages, downloading pictures from yandex servers and coordinating the bot's job. 

** For helping with visualization and especially for writing code for Telegram Bot special thanx to Kalinov Alexey.

**The main file**
search.cpp - core of the bot.

* "data" directory includes examples of YAML files being saved.

* capable of searching for images through the base

** For more detailed information related to the current progress consider looking through issues and changelog.txt **

**Visualization**

* All the work done can be seen using the Telegram Bot @MoviePosterBot

* It is capable of receiving the photo of a movie ad from chat and giving a link to Kinopoisk as a result.
