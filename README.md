This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### OpenCV Amateur Project ###

* This is the project based on The OPENCV library. Supporting by Denis Belyakov, 1st course student of the faculty of Computer Science, Higher School of Economics.

* The aim of this project is to create a program (or maybe an application), which will be able to show images from a base looking the same to the inputed one. It involves doing research in the Computer Vision sphere and learning about basic operations with pictures. 

Guided by Vadim Gorbachev.

* Current version 0.2


### About source files and directories ###

* first-steps.cpp and "First_steps" dir - includes examples of basic operation with images, such as rotation and color inversion. 
* detectors.cpp and "Detected_dotes" dir - includes examples of detectors' and descriptors' work plus matching.
* clustering.cpp and "clusters" dir - includes examples of clustering on one image.
* grads_and_etc.cpp and "Gradients" dir - shows the look of gradient vectors on pictures
* base_creation.cpp - reads pictures from the specified folder and saves them as visual words.
